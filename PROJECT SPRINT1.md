             As a user, I want the system to allow customer to create, login an account.
             As a user, I want the system to provide predefined categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Utilities, Entertainment) so that I can quickly start tracking my expenses without creating categories from scratch.
              As a user, as the system also provided predefined categories, I can quickly input my values into different areas.
As a user, I want to assign my income and expenses to specific categories so that I can understand how much I spend in each area.
